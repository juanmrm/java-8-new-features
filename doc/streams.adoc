= Java Stream

A stream is a sequence of data values supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.

We use the aggregate functions in SQL more often. An aggregate operation works on a list of item and results in a single value.
The result of an aggregate operation on stream may be a primitive value, an object, or a void for Stream.

== Streams Features (Collection vs Stream)
==== No Storage
- A *collection* is an in-memory data structure that stores all its elements.
- A *stream* pulls elements from a data source on-demand and passes them to a pipeline of operations for processing.
- For a *collection* we talk about the storage or how the data elements are stored, how to access data elements.
- For a *stream* we focus on the operations, for example, how to sum a stream.

==== Infinite Streams
- A collection cannot represent a group of infinite elements whereas a stream can.
- A stream can pull its elements from a data source. The data source can be a collection, a function that generates data, an I/O channel, etc.
(p.e: a stream can pull data from from a function which generates infinite number of elements)

==== Not Reusable
- A stream cannot be reused after calling a terminal operation.
- To perform a computation on the same elements from the same data source, we have to recreate the stream pipeline.
- A stream may throw an IllegalStateException in case of reusing.

== Java Stream Operation
==== External Iteration vs Internal Iteration
- With Collections we use external iteration. In external iteration we use a for or for each loop or obtain an iterator for a collection and process elements of the collections in a sequence.
- With Stream we didn't use loop statement to iterate through the List. We did the loop internally by stream.

==== Sequential
- External iteration typically means sequential code -> sequential code can be executed only by one thread.
- Streams are designed to process elements in parallel -> just replace stream() with parallelStream().

==== Imperative vs Functional
- In imperative programming we control not only what to do but also how to do it.
- In declarative programming we just need to tell what to do, the how part is handled by the system itself.
- Collections support imperative programming whereas streams support declarative programming.
- The Streams API supports the functional programming by using lambda expression.
- Operations on a stream produce a result without modifying the data source.

==== Intermediate vs Terminal operations
- Intermediate operations -> lazy operations, Terminal operations -> eager operations.

    A lazy operation does not process the elements until an eager operation is called on the stream.

- An intermediate operation on a stream produces another stream and we use streams link operations to create a stream pipeline.

== Stream API
Stream-related interfaces and classes are in the java.util.stream package.

[source,java]

----

Collections don't need to be closed, but a stream based on a closeable data source such as a file I/O channel, we can create the stream using a *try-with-resources* statement to get it closed automatically.

==== BaseStream
BaseStream interface defines all methods common to all types of streams:

- Iterator<T> iterator(): terminal operation that returns an iterator for the stream.
- sequential(): intermediate operation, returns a sequential stream. It converts a parallel stream into a sequential stream.
- parallel(): intermediate operation, returns a parallel stream. It convert a sequential stream into a parallel stream.
- boolean isParallel(): returns true if the stream is parallel, false otherwise.
- unordered(): intermediate operation, returns an unordered version of the stream.

==== Stream
Stream<T> interface represents a stream of the element type T.

The Stream<T> interface contains methods such as filter(), map(), reduce(), collect(), max(), min(), etc.

==== Ordered Streams vs. unordered Streams
A stream can be ordered or unordered. An ordered stream keeps the order of its elements.

The Streams API can convert an ordered stream to unordered or viceversa by applying an sorting intermediate operation.

=== Java Stream Create

You can create a stream:

- from values: _<T> Stream<T> of(T t) or <T> Stream<T> of(T...values)_
- from Empty streams: _<T> Stream<T> empty()_
- from functions: _<T> Stream<T> iterate(T  seed, UnaryOperator<T> f) or <T> Stream<T> generate(Supplier<T> s)_
- from arrays or from collections: _Arrays.stream_ or _collection.stream() / collection.parallelStream()_
- from Strings: _chars()_ from CharSequence interface returns an IntStream, values representing characters. _chars()_ method on a String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer return a stream of chars.
  _splitAsStream(CharSequence input)_ method from the java.util.regex.Pattern class returns a stream of String whose elements match the pattern.
- from files:  p.e: _Files.lines(path)_ read contents of a file using a stream or _Files.walk(dir)_ for read a path using stream
- from other sources

IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream from range -> _range(int start, int end) or rangeClosed(int start, int end)_

IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream random values (infinite stream) -> java.util.Random class provides ints(), longs(), and doubles() return infinite IntStream.
Other way is with new Random()::nextInt.

==== Operations
|===
| Nombre | Tipo | Descripci√≥n

|distinct
|Intermediate
|Returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements by checking equals() method.

|filter
|Intermediate
|Returns a stream that match the specified predicate.

|flatMap
|Intermediate
|Produces a stream flattened. Supports one-to-many mapping. It maps each element to a stream and then flaten the stream of streams to a stream.

|limit
|Intermediate
|truncates a stream by number.

|map
|Intermediate
|Performs one-to-one mapping on the stream and returns a NEW stream.

|peek
|Intermediate
|Applies the action for debugging.

|skip
|Intermediate
|Discards the first n elements and returns the remaining stream. If this stream contains fewer than requested, an empty stream is returned.

|sorted
|Intermediate
|Sort a stream according to natural order or the specified Comparator. For an ordered stream, the sort is stable.

|allMatch
|Terminal
|Returns true if all elements in the stream match the specified predicate, false otherwise. Returns true if the stream is empty.

|anyMatch
|Terminal
|Returns true if any element in the stream matches the specified predicate, false otherwise. Returns false if the stream is empty.

|findAny
|Terminal
|Returns any element from the stream. Returns an empty Optional object for an empty stream.

|findFirst
|Terminal
|Returns the first element of the stream. For an ordered stream, it returns the first element; for an unordered stream, it returns any element.

|noneMatch
|Terminal
|Returns true if no elements in the stream match the specified predicate, false otherwise. Returns true if the stream is empty.

|forEach
|Terminal
|Applies an action for each element in the stream.

|reduce
|Terminal
|Applies a reduction operation to computes a single value from the stream.

|collect
|Terminal
|To group data in a Stream. The collect() method is overloaded with two versions: _<R> R collect(Supplier<R> supplier, BiConsumer<R,? super T> accumulator, BiConsumer<R,R> combiner) or <R,A> R collect(Collector<?  super T,A,R> collector)_

|count
|Terminal
|Count the elements in this stream.
